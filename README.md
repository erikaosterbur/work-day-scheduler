# Homework 5: Work Day Scheduler

## Objectives

Create a work day scheduler that includes the current date at the top, a timeblock of standard business hours that is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, a space where a user can enter an event and click a save button to have that event saved in local storage, and current events in each timeblock from local storage upon page refresh.

The event-blocks are color coded to show that the current hour is red, past hours are gray, and future hours are green.](./assets/images/work-day-scheduler-webpage.png)
